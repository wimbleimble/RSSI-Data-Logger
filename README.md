Dunno if we're going to continue to use this but here's how to use it and stuff.

## Building

*The following assumes you are using windows, if anyone isn't let me know and i'll show how to do this on OSX/Linux. Funnily enough, it is substantially easier, because UNIX.*

### Build dependencies:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [MinGW-W64](https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/mingw-w64/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/installer/mingw-w64-install.exe?r=https%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fmingw-w64%2Ffiles%2FToolchains%2520targetting%2520Win32%2FPersonal%2520Builds%2Fmingw-builds%2Finstaller%2Fmingw-w64-install.exe%2Fdownload&ts=1614085033)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)
- Some sort of text editor, e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Installing and Bulding Everything
I made a little video showing the process of installing and building everything. Find it [here]().
